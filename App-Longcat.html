<b>LONGCAT</b><br>
<br>
Longcat is a puzzle game for SymbOS.<br>
<br>
The original version has been developed by Martin Magni as a browser and smartphone app:<br>
https://play.fancade.com/longcat<br>
<br>
Later it has been ported to the Amstrad CPC by Retro Parla under the name "Loganto" in march 2025:<br>

<br>
Finally it was ported to SymbOS by Prodatron/SymbiosiS, as a personal challenge to program a complete game for SymbOS in less than a day. It uses different graphics and the levels converted and created by Retro Parla.<br>
